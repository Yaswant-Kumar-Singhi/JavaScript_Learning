##### This all about comments. Now lets have some look at syntax of Java Script.

Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, just as they are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this semicolon if each of your statements are placed on a separate line. For example, the following code could be written without semicolons.

```
<script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
   <!--
      var a, b;   // How to declare variable 
      var1 = 10   // How to assign values
      var2 = 20
      var res = var1 + var2; //How to compute values 
   //-->
</script>
```
